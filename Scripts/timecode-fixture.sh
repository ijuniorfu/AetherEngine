# A picture that states its own source frame number, for `aetherctl play --picture-probe` (AE#418).
#
# Every axis observable the engine has describes what it WROTE. None of them says where AVPlayer then
# PUT that segment, and AE#408 shipped an early-opening gate on an assumption about exactly that. With
# this fixture the question needs no assumption: 12 blocks on one pixel row carry bit k of the frame
# index, so one row of pixels out of AVPlayer's own video output decodes to a source time.
#
# Pair it with Scripts/mkv-cue-fixture.py to get the AE#408 shape (Cues that are not sync samples):
#
#   Scripts/timecode-fixture.sh /tmp
#   python3 Scripts/mkv-cue-fixture.py /tmp/tc-drought.mkv /tmp/tc-cues-lie.mkv \
#       "$(python3 -c 'print(",".join(str(i) for i in range(1,120)))')"
#   swift run aetherctl play --seconds 12 --start-position 53 --picture-probe file:///tmp/tc-cues-lie.mkv
#
# `tc-drought.mkv` is the control arm (its Cues ARE its sync samples, `axisErr` stays 0 on every
# tick); `tc-cues-lie.mkv` is the case. A resume at 53 s re-aims the gate, opens at 43.000 against a
# boundary at 52.000 and reads `axisErr=-9.000`, the whole re-aim, constant for the run. (Before
# AE#423 evened out the backoff steps it opened at 38.417 and read `-13.583`.)
#
# AE#418 round 2 needs one seek on top of that, because the axis COMPOSES and a resume alone cannot
# show it. Add `--seek-every 12 --seek-count 1 --seek-pattern <target>` to the line above:
#
#   80  a seek onto an axis-true segment: the axis must stay -9.000 (the reporter's failing case)
#   65  a seek that re-places the overlong segment: the axis doubles to -18.000
#   60  a seek whose restart re-aims 5 s more: the axis composes to -14.000
#
# `capErr` is the verdict in all three, and it is the error a host placing a cue at `sourceTime`
# would make: about +0.017 (one frame at 24 fps) when the engine describes the axis correctly, and
# -8.983 for each of the three under 6.43.0.
#
# AE#418 round 3 uses the same three arms as a CONTROL. The axis is no longer predicted: the engine
# reads `AVPlayerItem.loadedTimeRanges` after each seam and measures where AVPlayer put the segment,
# so every arm above must print `#418 segN placement confirmed` and none of them may print
# `#418 segN placed on base ...`. The correcting case needs a fetch AVPlayer discards before using
# it, which needs a device slow enough to lag its own seek burst; it lives in the unit tests instead
# (`Issue418PlacementReconcileTests`, built from the reporter's numbers).
#
# For magnitudes this fixture cannot reach, engineer the droughts: a key 3 s below a boundary gives
# -3, 5 s gives -5, and a key under a second below one gives an axis AVPlayer THROWS AWAY at the
# next seek (measured: -0.500 and -0.875 snap to 0, -1.000 and above survive).
